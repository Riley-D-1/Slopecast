# Slopecast
An OSS (Open Source Software) website for the snowfields using a weather API. See the data about the world's favourite alpine areas for skiing and snowboarding in a quick snapshot! 
## Why did I make this project?
- No ads, no catch and no rubbish simple to use
- For Hackclub Siege (Theme: Winter)
- I love the mountains and checking the snowfall and weather of my favourite resorts I do almost everyday in winter.
- Build my flask skills and coding repoitre by building a site that has a backend
- Fufil shortcomings with existing software by specialising the data and providing everything needed for skiiers and snowboarders, being more detailed than other apps but not super detailed.
## How does it hit the theme?
- Mountains and Winter go hand in hand, many people love alpine sports and that's only possbile thanks to the season delivering snow onto our mountain ranges
